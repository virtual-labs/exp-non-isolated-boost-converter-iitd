### Procedure

a) Circuit formulation:
<br>
1. Connect the circuit to form a Boost converter by dragging the mouse from one terminal to other.
2. After completing all connections click on check connection button and verify the connections.<br>
   a) If all connections are correct then click on circuit diagram button to see the correct circuit<br>
   b) If any connection is wrong then click on red button to remove the wrong connections and redraw the right connections.

b) Operating the circuit: 
<br>
1) Set the values of Source Voltage (Vg), Load Resistance (R) and Duty Ratio (D).<br>
2) Press “RECORD” button to simulate the circuit and observe various waveforms.<br>
3) Change “Vg, R and D” to observe the waveforms at different operating conditions. <br>
 

c) Performance analysis of the circuit: 
 <br>
1) Set the values of Source Voltage (Vg), Load Resistance (R) and Duty Ratio (D).<br>
2) Select the “ICONS” in sequence to analyse and understand the circuit operation and performance.<br>
3) Follow the instructions given in respective experiment slide and press the “RECORD” button to fill the observation table.<br>
