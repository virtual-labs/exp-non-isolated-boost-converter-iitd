### To examine and understand the Boost Converter performance in respect of:

##### a)	Principle of operation followed by performance measurement of the boost converter.

##### b)	The impact of non-idealities (ESL, ESR, R<sub>DS(ON)</sub>, V<sub>FD</sub>, R) on voltage boosting capability of the converter.

##### c)	The loading effect on efficiency of the converter.

##### d)	The voltage and current stress of components and device selection.
