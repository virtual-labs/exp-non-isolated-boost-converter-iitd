### To examine and understand the Boost Converter performance in respect of:

#### a) Principle of operation followed by brief analysis to obtain the voltage gain characteristics of the boost converter.

#### b) The impact of non-idealities (ESL, ESR, RDS(ON),VFD, R) on voltage boosting capability of the converter.

#### c) The loading effect on efficiency of the converter.

#### d) The voltage and current stress of components and device selection.
